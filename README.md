# Extension of Gio

See [gioui.org](https://gioui.org).

This is a set of widgets made for my own use. They replaces (or complements) gioui.org/widget and
gioui.org/widget/material but the rest of the gio code is imported without modifications.

The code is copied extensively from the following sources:

* https://github.com/gioui/gio
* https://github.com/gioui/gio-x.git
* https://github.com/gioui/gio-example.git

THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS - ANYTHING CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME

# Features

## Material design

Quite a lot of effort has gone into making it look like Google's examples of material design forms. The shadows are noe
almost identical, and hover/focus are at least similar.

## Keyboard only operation

All (TODO) widgets handle keyboard only operation. Focus is moved py TAB/SHIFT-TAB keys. The tab sequence is given by
the declaration sequence automatically. No mouse is needed.

## Extended theming

The theme is very much extended, with default values for all colors and sizes. You can set up several themes for
different types of buttons etc, and use the themes when declaring the widgets.

## Dynamic resizing

Everything scales with the text size, and the text size is set automatically as a fraction of the window size. This
makes it easy to write programs that are maximized to fill the screen, or are operating mostly in full-screen mode. (
Creating maximized windows depends on a small modification of gio itself, and is implemented in my gio fork)

## Importing gio directly

The gio module itself does not need to be modified. The excellent work by Elias Naur and Chris Waldon is used without
modifications. My widgets are only high-level extensions.

## Widget configuration by optional arguments

Using a similar technique to what is used for window setup, you can configure the widgets as needed. Functions with
optional parameters is not possible in Golang, but you can have a variable number of interface parameters as
in ```func(options ...Option)``` . See example below

## Easy setup of forms

Here is an example from demo.go. The widgets can take a variable number of options for things like width and hints.
Otherwise, default fallbacks are used.

```
	root = wid.MakeList(
		th, layout.Vertical,
		wid.Label(th, "Demo page", text.Middle, 2.0),
		wid.Button(th, "WIDE BUTTON",
			wid.W(950),
			wid.Pad(30, 15, 15, 0),
			wid.Hint("This is a dummy button - it has no function except displaying this text, testing long help texts. Perhaps breaking into several lines")),
		wid.MakeFlex(
			wid.Label(th, "Dark mode", text.Start, 1.0),
			wid.Switch(th, darkMode, onSwitchMode),
		),
		wid.Checkbox(th, "Checkbox", darkMode, nil),
		wid.MakeFlex(
			wid.RoundButton(th, icons.ContentAdd,
				wid.Hint("This is another dummy button - it has no function except displaying this text, testing long help texts. Perhaps breaking into several lines")),
			wid.Button(th, "Home", wid.BtnIcon(icons.ActionHome), wid.Disable(&darkMode)),
			wid.Button(th, "Check", wid.BtnIcon(icons.ActionCheckCircle)),
			wid.Button(&thb, "Change color", wid.Handler(onClick)),
			wid.TextButton(th, "Text button"),
			wid.OutlineButton(th, "Outline button"),
			wid.Label(th, "Disabled", text.End, 1.0),
			wid.Switch(th, false, doDisable),
		),
		wid.MakeFlex(
			wid.Combo(th, unit.Value{}, 0, []string{"Option A", "Option B", "Option C"}),
			wid.Combo(th, unit.Value{200, 0}, 1, []string{"Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"}),
			wid.Combo(th, unit.Value{300, 0}, 1, []string{"Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"}),
			wid.Combo(th, unit.Value{}, 0, []string{"Option A", "Option B", "Option C"}),
		),
		wid.Edit(th, wid.Hint("Value 1"), wid.W(950)),
		wid.Edit(th, wid.Hint("Value 2")),
		wid.Edit(th, wid.Hint("Value 3")),
```
